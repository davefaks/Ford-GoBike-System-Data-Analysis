# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves univariate, bivariate, and multivariate explorations of a dataset containing information on 183,412 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system in February 2019, covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

Following preliminary data wrangling, the project has two main parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Python visualization libraries are used to systematically explore the dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

2. **Explanatory Data Visualization**: A short presentation using a slideshow in Jupyter Notebook is developed to illustrate interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in the dataset during the exploratory data visualization.
